# Visualizing CSV data using ChartJS

A simple line graph created using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

The graph is the plot for different values of the Zonal Annual Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies collected by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/).

The CSV file for the data can be downloaded from [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
